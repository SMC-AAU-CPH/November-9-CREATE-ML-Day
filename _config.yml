description: During COVID, both the demand on AI-related digital skills and self-studies on machine learning raised significantly. The field is on the first sight very well-suited for remote data gathering, training, testing, and deployment. What missing however, was the collective experimentation to learn and use multiple models in tandem. Tools such as [RunwayML](https://app.runwayml.com/models) enable such workflow for experiments with motion capture, image synthesis, object recognition, and many more, but an expert guidance is typically needed for building a good portfolio for employability and continuous education.
